To do RTL Model

-> Logic gates : AND, NOT, OR, XOR : presentation 1
-> Multiplexer : presentation 2
-> Adder : presentation 3 (need logic gates)
-> Registers, flip-flop : presentation 5
-> Datapath : presentation 7 (need quite everything)
-> Controller and FSM : presentation 9 (already done in another course by Arthur)
-> Model of processor : presentation 10

Every part must come with its tests
