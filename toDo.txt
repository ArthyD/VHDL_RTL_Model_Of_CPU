To adapt from previous work
-> Set of instructions to RISC-V done
-> Switch to 32 bits done

To do RTL Model
1st week :
-> Logic gates : AND, NOT, OR, XOR, ... done
-> Multiplexer done
-> Adder done
-> Registers, flip-flop done

2nd week :
-> ALU done
-> register file done 
-> FSM and ID done
-> tests done

Following :
-> Datapath (Roman)
-> Full controler (Arthur)
-> Connect everything : memory + controler + Datapath
-> tests (fill memory and see behavior of CPU)

What's missing ? 
-> PC controler in order to use branch instruction with conditions : 
    might need adaptation in FSM, need to use compare block to enable or not
    the output of PC
-> Instruction register
-> Address register
-> Increment PC block
