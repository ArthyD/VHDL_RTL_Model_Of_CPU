To adapt from previous work
-> Set of instructions to RISC-V done
-> Switch to 32 bits done

To do RTL Model
1st week :
-> Logic gates : AND, NOT, OR, XOR, ... done
-> Multiplexer done
-> Adder done
-> Registers, flip-flop done

2nd week :
-> ALU done
-> register file done 
-> FSM and ID done
-> tests done

Following :
-> Datapath (Roman)
-> Full controler done need to be tested
-> Connect everything : memory + controler + Datapath
-> tests (fill memory and see behavior of CPU)

What's missing ? 
-> PC controler in order to use branch instruction with conditions : 
    might need adaptation in FSM, need to use compare block to enable or not 
    the output of PC done 
-> Address register done
-> memory interface done
-> Increment PC block 
-> Instruction register done

Remarks 
-> might need a multiplexer controled by calc_on_PC and cmd_calc coming from fsm in datapath
    to see which one is the data_in
    if calc_on_PC : data_in = PC
    if cmd_cal : data_in = imm 
    they are put in register during fetch and then the operation is performed during execution **done in controler
-> PC_controler needs two regsiters out from resgister_file as input to do the checks on it 
    and the opcode done
