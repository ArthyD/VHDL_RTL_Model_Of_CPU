General goal

To adapt from previous work
-> Set of instructions to RISC-V
-> Switch to 32 bits

To do RTL Model
1st week :
-> Logic gates : AND, NOT, OR, XOR, ... : presentation 1 Maelys
-> Multiplexer : presentation 2 Tim
-> Adder : presentation 3 (need logic gates) Arthur
-> Registers, flip-flop : presentation 5 Roman

Following :
-> Datapath : presentation 7 (need quite everything)
-> Controller and FSM : presentation 9 (already done in another course by Arthur)
-> Model of processor : presentation 10

Every part must come with its tests
